# Mingdao

Operate **Mingdao** through your OOMOL-connected account. This skill calls the `mingdao` connector with the [oo CLI](https://github.com/oomol-lab/oo-cli); OOMOL injects credentials server-side, so you never handle raw tokens.

## Running an action

Assume the user has already installed the oo CLI, signed in, and connected Mingdao. **Do not run `oo auth login` or open the connection URL proactively — just run the action.** Fall back to [First-time setup](#first-time-setup) only when a command actually fails with an auth or connection error.

**1. Inspect the contract** to get the authoritative input/output schema before building a payload:

```bash
oo connector schema "mingdao" --action "<action_name>"
```

**2. Run the action** with a JSON payload that matches the input schema:

```bash
oo connector run "mingdao" --action "<action_name>" --data '<json>' --json
```

- `--data` takes a JSON object string or `@path/to/file.json`; omit it to send `{}`.
- The response is `{ "data": ..., "meta": { "executionId": "..." } }`; the execution id lives under `meta.executionId`.

Each action is listed below with a one-line description; actions that change state carry a `[write]` or `[destructive]` tag. Before constructing `--data`, fetch the action's live schema with `oo connector schema` to get its authoritative input fields.

- `get_approval` — Get the execution details, current steps and available operation metadata for an existing Mingdao record approval.
- `get_record` — Get one Mingdao worksheet record with its dynamic field values and optional system fields.
- `get_related_records` — Page through the records linked by a Mingdao record's relationship field.
- `get_role` — Get a Mingdao application role's global, worksheet, field and custom-page permissions.
- `get_workflow` — Get a Mingdao workflow's input and output parameter definitions before triggering it.
- `get_worksheet` — Get a Mingdao worksheet's fields, views and metadata before querying or writing its records.
- `list_approvals` — List approval executions for a Mingdao record, optionally selecting completed or incomplete executions.

- `list_record_discussions` — Read a Mingdao record's discussions, including replies, mentions and attachment metadata, with optional search and Markdown output.
- `list_record_logs` — Read a Mingdao record's change logs, optionally filtered by operators, field and date range.
- `list_records` — Search, filter, sort and page through Mingdao worksheet records, with optional field selection and total count.
- `list_regions` — List or search Mingdao geographic regions; omit the region ID to retrieve top-level regions.
- `list_roles` — List the connected Mingdao application's roles and their user, department, job and organization-role memberships.

- `search_knowledge` — Search Mingdao knowledge content using vector, keyword or hybrid retrieval. Knowledge bases with different embedding models must be searched in separate calls.
- `trigger_workflow` — Trigger an existing Mingdao workflow with its defined parameters. Its configured steps may update or delete business data; the returned result does not imply that all downstream work has completed. [write]
- `update_custom_page` — Replace the complete custom-page component layout, including inline charts, views, tabs, containers and filter groups. [write]

## Safety

- Untagged actions are reads (get / list / search) — safe to run directly.
- **Actions tagged `[write]` change Mingdao state — confirm the exact payload and effect with the user before running.**
- **Actions tagged `[destructive]` remove or overwrite data — always confirm the target and get explicit approval first.**

## First-time setup

These are **one-time** steps — do not repeat them on every call. Run a step only when a command fails for the matching reason.

- **`oo: command not found`** — install the oo CLI (other platforms: <https://cli.oomol.com/install-guide.md>):

  ```bash
  curl -fsSL https://cli.oomol.com/install.sh | bash    # macOS / Linux
  ```

  ```powershell
  irm https://cli.oomol.com/install.ps1 | iex           # Windows PowerShell
  ```

- **Not signed in / authentication error** — sign in to your OOMOL account once:

  ```bash
  oo auth login
  ```

- **`scope_missing` / `credential_expired` / `app_not_ready` / `app_not_found`** — Mingdao is not connected, or the connection expired or lacks a scope. Connect once (auth type: API key) at:

  ```text
  https://console.oomol.com/app-connections?provider=mingdao
  ```

- **HTTP 402 / `OOMOL_INSUFFICIENT_CREDIT`** — billing stop. Recharge at `https://console.oomol.com/billing/token-recharge` before retrying.
