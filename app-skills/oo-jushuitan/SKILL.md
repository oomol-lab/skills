# Jushuitan ERP

Operate **Jushuitan ERP** through your OOMOL-connected account. This skill calls the `jushuitan` connector with the [oo CLI](https://github.com/oomol-lab/oo-cli); OOMOL injects credentials server-side, so you never handle raw tokens.

## Running an action

Assume the user has already installed the oo CLI, signed in, and connected Jushuitan ERP. **Do not run `oo auth login` or open the connection URL proactively — just run the action.** Fall back to [First-time setup](#first-time-setup) only when a command actually fails with an auth or connection error.

**1. Inspect the contract** to get the authoritative input/output schema before building a payload:

```bash
oo connector schema "jushuitan" --action "<action_name>"
```

**2. Run the action** with a JSON payload that matches the input schema:

```bash
oo connector run "jushuitan" --action "<action_name>" --data '<json>' --json
```

- `--data` takes a JSON object string or `@path/to/file.json`; omit it to send `{}`.
- The response is `{ "data": ..., "meta": { "executionId": "..." } }`; the execution id lives under `meta.executionId`.

Each action is listed below with a one-line description; actions that change state carry a `[write]` or `[destructive]` tag. Before constructing `--data`, fetch the action's live schema with `oo connector schema` to get its authoritative input fields.

### Shipment records and tracking limits

**`list_shipments` returns shipment records, including shipment time, tracking number, and carrier; Jushuitan OpenWeb does not provide tracking events.** These records cannot establish pickup status, the current transit milestone, or the last tracking update. Shipment time is not pickup time, and a tracking number does not prove pickup. Information visible in the Jushuitan dashboard is not necessarily available through its open API.

- For shipment counts, carrier distributions, or shipment details, use the Jushuitan actions normally.
- For pickup status, transit progress, or stale-tracking alerts, explain that a separate tracking source is required. Use Kuaidi100 (快递100) for domestic courier tracking: first verify that the current environment exposes the service and that it is connected, discover its available actions, and read the latest action schema before calling it. Do not invent action names or assume account access.
- If the tracking service, connection, or required query parameters are missing, state exactly what is missing and still complete the independently deliverable Jushuitan shipment query. Do not count missing tracking events or failed queries as awaiting pickup. Do not default to scraping carrier websites or repeatedly solving CAPTCHAs for ongoing monitoring.
- A “no new tracking event for over 12 hours” alert requires the application to persist the latest valid event timestamp and check it on a schedule; event-change webhooks alone are insufficient. Display no tracking data, query failures, awaiting pickup, and stalled transit separately. Stop stale-tracking alerts for delivered shipments.

## Safety

- Untagged actions are reads (get / list / search) — safe to run directly.
- **Actions tagged `[write]` change Jushuitan ERP state — confirm the exact payload and effect with the user before running.**
- **Actions tagged `[destructive]` remove or overwrite data — always confirm the target and get explicit approval first.**

## First-time setup

These are **one-time** steps — do not repeat them on every call. Run a step only when a command fails for the matching reason.

- **`oo: command not found`** — install the oo CLI (other platforms: <https://cli.oomol.com/install-guide.md>):

  ```bash
  curl -fsSL https://cli.oomol.com/install.sh | bash    # macOS / Linux
  ```

  ```powershell
  irm https://cli.oomol.com/install.ps1 | iex           # Windows PowerShell
  ```

- **Not signed in / authentication error** — sign in to your OOMOL account once:

  ```bash
  oo auth login
  ```

- **`scope_missing` / `credential_expired` / `app_not_ready` / `app_not_found`** — Jushuitan ERP is not connected, or the connection expired or lacks a scope. Connect once (auth type: OAuth2) at:

  ```text
  https://console.oomol.com/app-connections?provider=jushuitan
  ```

- **HTTP 402 / `OOMOL_INSUFFICIENT_CREDIT`** — billing stop. Recharge at `https://console.oomol.com/billing/token-recharge` before retrying.
