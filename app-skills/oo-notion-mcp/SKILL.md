# Notion MCP

Operate **Notion MCP** through your OOMOL-connected account. This skill calls the `notion_mcp` connector with the [oo CLI](https://github.com/oomol-lab/oo-cli); OOMOL injects credentials server-side, so you never handle raw tokens.

## Running an action

Assume the user has already installed the oo CLI, signed in, and connected Notion MCP. **Do not run `oo auth login` or open the connection URL proactively — just run the action.** Fall back to [First-time setup](#first-time-setup) only when a command actually fails with an auth or connection error.

**1. Inspect the contract** to get the authoritative input/output schema before building a payload:

```bash
oo connector schema "notion_mcp" --action "<action_name>"
```

**2. Run the action** with a JSON payload that matches the input schema:

```bash
oo connector run "notion_mcp" --action "<action_name>" --data '<json>' --json
```

- `--data` takes a JSON object string or `@path/to/file.json`; omit it to send `{}`.
- The response is `{ "data": ..., "meta": { "executionId": "..." } }`; the execution id lives under `meta.executionId`.

Each action is listed below with a one-line description; actions that change state carry a `[write]` or `[destructive]` tag. Before constructing `--data`, fetch the action's live schema with `oo connector schema` to get its authoritative input fields.

## Available actions

- `create_comment` — Comment on a Notion page through notion-create-comment: at the top level, as a reply to a comment or a discussion, or as a new discussion on selected content. Returns the comment the server named and the raw response. [write]
- `create_pages` — Create one or more Notion pages through notion-create-pages, under a page, a database, a data source or a teamspace, or as a private draft. Returns the pages the server named, an async task ID when it deferred the work, and the raw response. [write]
- `fetch_page` — Read one Notion page through notion-fetch by ID or URL. Returns the title, properties block, Markdown content, a truncated flag, and the raw response.
- `get_self` — Identify the connected Notion user through notion-get-users with user_id self. Returns the user ID, name, and email the server reports.
- `list_comments` — List the comments on one Notion page through notion-get-comments, flattened across discussions. Block-level and resolved discussions are included unless turned off; the server offers no paging.
- `search` — Search Notion pages through notion-search with optional text, sort, page size, date-range and creator filters. Returns typed results, the search type that ran, the server's notices about dropped filters, and the raw response. Filtering by editor or last-edited date and sorting by date need a Business or Enterprise plan; other plans drop them and name them in notices. When the connection can use AI search, a non-empty keyword query with no exact filter and relevance order runs AI search and can return results from connected apps. Notion allows 30 searches a minute.
- `tool_access` — Report each MCP tool's access status on the connected Notion plan through notion-get-tool-access, keyed by the tool's base name such as search, with the parameters the plan restricts and the reason for each, such as the edited-by search filter below the Business plan.
- `update_page` — Change one Notion page through notion-update-page: its properties, a targeted search-and-replace in its content, its whole content, or an insertion at the start or the end. Returns the page ID, the URL when the server names one, an async task ID when it deferred the work, and the raw response. [write]

## Safety

- Untagged actions are reads (get / list / search) — safe to run directly.
- **Actions tagged `[write]` change Notion MCP state — confirm the exact payload and effect with the user before running.**
- **Actions tagged `[destructive]` remove or overwrite data — always confirm the target and get explicit approval first.**

## First-time setup

These are **one-time** steps — do not repeat them on every call. Run a step only when a command fails for the matching reason.

- **`oo: command not found`** — install the oo CLI (other platforms: <https://cli.oomol.com/install-guide.md>):

  ```bash
  curl -fsSL https://cli.oomol.com/install.sh | bash    # macOS / Linux
  ```

  ```powershell
  irm https://cli.oomol.com/install.ps1 | iex           # Windows PowerShell
  ```

- **Not signed in / authentication error** — sign in to your OOMOL account once:

  ```bash
  oo auth login
  ```

- **`scope_missing` / `credential_expired` / `app_not_ready` / `app_not_found`** — Notion MCP is not connected, or the connection expired or lacks a scope. Connect once (auth type: OAuth2) at:

  ```text
  https://console.oomol.com/connections/notion_mcp
  ```

- **HTTP 402 / `OOMOL_INSUFFICIENT_CREDIT`** — billing stop. Recharge at `https://console.oomol.com/billing/token-recharge` before retrying.
