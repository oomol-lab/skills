# GenPage

Operate **GenPage** through your OOMOL-connected account. This skill calls the `genpage` connector with the [oo CLI](https://github.com/oomol-lab/oo-cli); OOMOL injects credentials server-side, so you never handle raw tokens.

## Running an action

Assume the user has already installed the oo CLI, signed in, and connected GenPage. **Do not run `oo auth login` or open the connection URL proactively — just run the action.** Fall back to [First-time setup](#first-time-setup) only when a command actually fails with an auth or connection error.

**1. Inspect the contract** to get the authoritative input/output schema before building a payload:

```bash
oo connector schema "genpage" --action "<action_name>"
```

**2. Run the action** with a JSON payload that matches the input schema:

```bash
oo connector run "genpage" --action "<action_name>" --data '<json>' --json
```

- `--data` takes a JSON object string or `@path/to/file.json`; omit it to send `{}`.
- The response is `{ "data": ..., "meta": { "executionId": "..." } }`; the execution id lives under `meta.executionId`.

Each action is listed below with a one-line description; actions that change state carry a `[write]` or `[destructive]` tag. Before constructing `--data`, fetch the action's live schema with `oo connector schema` to get its authoritative input fields.

## Available actions

- `add_audience_leads` — Add existing GenPage leads to an audience. [write]
- `create_audience` — Create a named audience in a GenPage workspace. [write]
- `create_campaign` — Create an empty GenPage campaign for a workspace. [write]
- `delete_audience` — Delete a GenPage audience while keeping all leads in the workspace. [destructive]
- `get_campaign_analytics` — Get visit and click performance metrics for GenPage campaigns.
- `get_credit_balance` — Get the account credit balance and usage for a GenPage workspace.
- `link_audience_to_campaign` — Link a GenPage audience to a campaign so its leads receive campaign pages.
- `list_audiences` — List audiences in a GenPage workspace.
- `list_campaigns` — List campaigns in a GenPage workspace.
- `list_workspace_variables` — List the default and custom lead variables in a GenPage workspace.
- `list_workspaces` — List the GenPage workspaces accessible to the API token.
- `remove_audience_leads` — Remove leads from a GenPage audience without deleting the leads. [destructive]
- `unlink_audience_from_campaign` — Unlink a GenPage audience from a campaign without deleting leads or pages.

## Safety

- Untagged actions are reads (get / list / search) — safe to run directly.
- **Actions tagged `[write]` change GenPage state — confirm the exact payload and effect with the user before running.**
- **Actions tagged `[destructive]` remove or overwrite data — always confirm the target and get explicit approval first.**

## First-time setup

These are **one-time** steps — do not repeat them on every call. Run a step only when a command fails for the matching reason.

- **`oo: command not found`** — install the oo CLI (other platforms: <https://cli.oomol.com/install-guide.md>):

  ```bash
  curl -fsSL https://cli.oomol.com/install.sh | bash    # macOS / Linux
  ```

  ```powershell
  irm https://cli.oomol.com/install.ps1 | iex           # Windows PowerShell
  ```

- **Not signed in / authentication error** — sign in to your OOMOL account once:

  ```bash
  oo auth login
  ```

- **`scope_missing` / `credential_expired` / `app_not_ready` / `app_not_found`** — GenPage is not connected, or the connection expired or lacks a scope. Connect once (auth type: API key) at:

  ```text
  https://console.oomol.com/app-connections?provider=genpage
  ```

- **HTTP 402 / `OOMOL_INSUFFICIENT_CREDIT`** — billing stop. Recharge at `https://console.oomol.com/billing/token-recharge` before retrying.
