# Algolia

Operate **Algolia** through your OOMOL-connected account. This skill calls the `algolia` connector with the [oo CLI](https://github.com/oomol-lab/oo-cli); OOMOL injects credentials server-side, so you never handle raw tokens.

Category: Developer Tools, Data & Analytics. Exposes 9 action(s).

## Running an action

Assume the user has already installed the oo CLI, signed in, and connected Algolia. **Do not run `oo auth login` or open the connection URL proactively — just run the action.** Fall back to [First-time setup](#first-time-setup) only when a command actually fails with an auth or connection error.

**1. Inspect the contract** to get the authoritative input/output schema before building a payload:

```bash
oo connector schema "algolia" --action "<action_name>"
```

**2. Run the action** with a JSON payload that matches the input schema:

```bash
oo connector run "algolia" --action "<action_name>" --data '<json>' --json
```

- `--data` takes a JSON object string or `@path/to/file.json`; omit it to send `{}`.
- The response is `{ "data": ..., "meta": { "executionId": "..." } }`; the execution id lives under `meta.executionId`.

Each action below links to a reference file with its purpose and exact commands. Read the linked file, then fetch the live schema with `oo connector schema` before constructing `--data`.

## Available actions

- [`add_or_replace_record`](actions/add_or_replace_record.md) — Add a new record or replace an existing Algolia record using its objectID.
- [`browse_index`](actions/browse_index.md) — Browse records from a single Algolia index, optionally continuing with a cursor.
- [`delete_records_by_filter`](actions/delete_records_by_filter.md) — Delete Algolia records that match a filter expression.
- [`get_record`](actions/get_record.md) — Retrieve a single record from an Algolia index by objectID.
- [`list_indices`](actions/list_indices.md) — List Algolia indices accessible to the current API key.
- [`save_rule`](actions/save_rule.md) — Save a single Algolia rule by objectID.
- [`save_synonym`](actions/save_synonym.md) — Save a single Algolia synonym by objectID.
- [`search_index`](actions/search_index.md) — Search a single Algolia index with the most common search parameters.
- [`update_record_partially`](actions/update_record_partially.md) — Partially update an existing Algolia record by objectID.

## Safety

- Read actions (get / list / search) are safe to run directly.
- **Create, update, send, or post actions change Algolia state — confirm the exact payload and effect with the user before running.**
- **Delete or remove actions are destructive — always confirm the target and get explicit approval first.**

## First-time setup

These are **one-time** steps — do not repeat them on every call. Run a step only when a command fails for the matching reason.

- **`oo: command not found`** — install the oo CLI (other platforms: <https://cli.oomol.com/install-guide.md>):

  ```bash
  curl -fsSL https://cli.oomol.com/install.sh | bash    # macOS / Linux
  ```

  ```powershell
  irm https://cli.oomol.com/install.ps1 | iex           # Windows PowerShell
  ```

- **Not signed in / authentication error** — sign in to your OOMOL account once:

  ```bash
  oo auth login
  ```

- **`scope_missing` / `credential_expired` / `app_not_ready` / `app_not_found`** — Algolia is not connected, or the connection expired or lacks a scope. Connect once (auth type: API key) at:

  ```text
  https://console.oomol.com/app-connections?provider=algolia
  ```

- **HTTP 402 / `OOMOL_INSUFFICIENT_CREDIT`** — billing stop. Recharge at `https://console.oomol.com/billing/token-recharge` before retrying.
