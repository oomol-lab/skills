# Gmail

Operate **Gmail** through your OOMOL-connected account. This skill calls the `gmail` connector with the [oo CLI](https://github.com/oomol-lab/oo-cli); OOMOL injects credentials server-side, so you never handle raw tokens.

Category: Communication, Productivity. Exposes 46 action(s).

## Running an action

Assume the user has already installed the oo CLI, signed in, and connected Gmail. **Do not run `oo auth login` or open the connection URL proactively — just run the action.** Fall back to [First-time setup](#first-time-setup) only when a command actually fails with an auth or connection error.

**1. Inspect the contract** to get the authoritative input/output schema before building a payload:

```bash
oo connector schema "gmail" --action "<action_name>"
```

**2. Run the action** with a JSON payload that matches the input schema:

```bash
oo connector run "gmail" --action "<action_name>" --data '<json>' --json
```

- `--data` takes a JSON object string or `@path/to/file.json`; omit it to send `{}`.
- The response is `{ "data": ..., "meta": { "executionId": "..." } }`; the execution id lives under `meta.executionId`.

Each action below links to a reference file with its purpose and exact commands. Read the linked file, then fetch the live schema with `oo connector schema` before constructing `--data`.

## Available actions

- [`add_label_to_email`](actions/add_label_to_email.md) — Add and/or remove labels on a single Gmail message. Provide at least one label mutation and use label IDs from `list_labels`.
- [`batch_modify_messages`](actions/batch_modify_messages.md) — Add and/or remove labels on up to 1,000 Gmail messages in one request. Use this for bulk archive, mark-as-read, or custom label workflows.
- [`create_draft`](actions/create_draft.md) — Create a Gmail draft with a simplified input and output shape. This compatibility action returns only the created `draftId`.
- [`create_email_draft`](actions/create_email_draft.md) — Create a Gmail draft with recipients, subject, body, and optional threading. Use `threadId` to draft a reply in an existing conversation.
- [`create_filter`](actions/create_filter.md) — Create a Gmail filter with matching criteria and resulting actions. Use this to automatically organize incoming mail.
- [`create_label`](actions/create_label.md) — Create a new Gmail label and return its internal label ID. Use the returned ID in downstream label modification actions.
- [`delete_draft`](actions/delete_draft.md) — Permanently delete a Gmail draft by draft ID instead of sending it.
- [`delete_filter`](actions/delete_filter.md) — Permanently delete a Gmail filter by filter ID.
- [`delete_label`](actions/delete_label.md) — Permanently delete a user-created Gmail label from the mailbox. This removes the label definition itself rather than just detaching it from one message.
- [`fetch_emails`](actions/fetch_emails.md) — List Gmail messages with optional query, label, and pagination filters. Use `detail` to choose between identifiers only, lightweight summaries, or full normalized messages.
- [`fetch_message_by_message_id`](actions/fetch_message_by_message_id.md) — Fetch a Gmail message by message ID with a controllable response format. Use this when you need the normalized full message payload instead of the simplified `get_message` output.
- [`fetch_message_by_thread_id`](actions/fetch_message_by_thread_id.md) — Fetch all messages in a Gmail thread. Use this to inspect the full conversation payload for a known `threadId`.
- [`get_auto_forwarding`](actions/get_auto_forwarding.md) — Get the current Gmail auto-forwarding configuration, including enabled status, forwarding address, and disposition.
- [`get_draft`](actions/get_draft.md) — Get a Gmail draft by draft ID. Use the `format` parameter to control how much message detail is returned.
- [`get_filter`](actions/get_filter.md) — Get a Gmail filter by filter ID so you can inspect its criteria and actions.
- [`get_label`](actions/get_label.md) — Get details for a Gmail label, including its name, type, visibility settings, counts, and optional color.
- [`get_language_settings`](actions/get_language_settings.md) — Get the Gmail display language settings for the connected account.
- [`get_message`](actions/get_message.md) — Get a Gmail message by message ID with a simplified normalized output. Use this when you only need subject, from, to, date, and body.
- [`get_profile`](actions/get_profile.md) — Get the connected Gmail profile, including mailbox totals and the current `historyId`. Use the returned `historyId` as the checkpoint for incremental sync via `list_history`.
- [`get_vacation_settings`](actions/get_vacation_settings.md) — Get the Gmail vacation responder settings, including whether auto-replies are enabled and their current content.
- [`list_drafts`](actions/list_drafts.md) — List Gmail drafts with pagination, and optionally hydrate each draft into full message details when `verbose` is true.
- [`list_filters`](actions/list_filters.md) — List Gmail filters for the mailbox. Use this to audit existing rules or avoid creating duplicates.
- [`list_forwarding_addresses`](actions/list_forwarding_addresses.md) — List the forwarding addresses that are registered on the Gmail account.
- [`list_history`](actions/list_history.md) — List Gmail mailbox change history after a known `startHistoryId`. Use this for incremental sync and checkpoint the latest returned `historyId`.
- [`list_labels`](actions/list_labels.md) — List all system and user-created Gmail labels. Use this to discover the internal label IDs required by label mutation actions.
- [`list_threads`](actions/list_threads.md) — List Gmail threads with optional query filtering and pagination. Spam and trash stay excluded unless you explicitly target them in the query.
- [`modify_thread_labels`](actions/modify_thread_labels.md) — Add and/or remove labels on every message in a Gmail thread. Use this when the label change should apply to the whole conversation.
- [`move_thread_to_trash`](actions/move_thread_to_trash.md) — Move an entire Gmail thread to trash, including all messages in that conversation.
- [`move_to_trash`](actions/move_to_trash.md) — Move a Gmail message to trash. The message remains recoverable until it is permanently deleted by Gmail.
- [`patch_label`](actions/patch_label.md) — Patch a user-created Gmail label. Use this for partial updates to the label name, visibility settings, or color.
- [`reply_email`](actions/reply_email.md) — Reply to an existing Gmail thread using the original message's reply headers. This compatibility action returns only the new `messageId`.
- [`reply_to_thread`](actions/reply_to_thread.md) — Reply to an existing Gmail thread while preserving Gmail threading. Use this when you want the reply to stay in the same conversation and optionally override recipients.
- [`search_threads`](actions/search_threads.md) — Search Gmail threads by query and return lightweight thread summaries. Spam and trash stay excluded unless you explicitly target them in the query.

## Safety

- Read actions (get / list / search) are safe to run directly.
- **Create, update, send, or post actions change Gmail state — confirm the exact payload and effect with the user before running.**
- **Delete or remove actions are destructive — always confirm the target and get explicit approval first.**

## First-time setup

These are **one-time** steps — do not repeat them on every call. Run a step only when a command fails for the matching reason.

- **`oo: command not found`** — install the oo CLI (other platforms: <https://cli.oomol.com/install-guide.md>):

  ```bash
  curl -fsSL https://cli.oomol.com/install.sh | bash    # macOS / Linux
  ```

  ```powershell
  irm https://cli.oomol.com/install.ps1 | iex           # Windows PowerShell
  ```

- **Not signed in / authentication error** — sign in to your OOMOL account once:

  ```bash
  oo auth login
  ```

- **`scope_missing` / `credential_expired` / `app_not_ready` / `app_not_found`** — Gmail is not connected, or the connection expired or lacks a scope. Connect once (auth type: OAuth2) at:

  ```text
  https://console.oomol.com/app-connections?provider=gmail
  ```

- **HTTP 402 / `OOMOL_INSUFFICIENT_CREDIT`** — billing stop. Recharge at `https://console.oomol.com/billing/token-recharge` before retrying.
